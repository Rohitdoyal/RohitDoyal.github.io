 • Trained an ensemble of pseudo models and deployed it on a website to find top
 similar images and evaluated its performance using MAP score.
 • Trained a CNN model with 5 parallellast fully connected layer seach acting as a
 classifier on classes 16 to 25 on CIFAR100 dataset and used euclidean distance
 between output of the lastlayer for test image and images from data set to get
 similarity score. Deployed this model using flask on localhost
